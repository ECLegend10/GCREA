# GCREA
First, this project is used for assignment purposes. 
I did not make this android application with my own free will.  

## GCREA stands for Green Club Request and Event Application. 
(I should have called this GCERA XD)
Basically, it is for a club, which is Green Club, in my university, Swinburne Sarawak. 
Event part would be the committee members could add Green Club events and activities to the application so the users can view the event details and also join by just clicking on the join button.  

For request, our club encourages recycle so we would be happy if there is a method where the user could request for a time to recycle their items by passing the items to us. 

To add on, there is a point system (even though not fully implemented) for the users to be hyped to join the activities and also recycle their items as they can get rewards from the points they earned.  

Feel free to take a look on the code, and try the application out. 
Honestly, I wouldn't call it complete since it's buggy and can have more and more features in it, so feel free to help me upgrade it too.
